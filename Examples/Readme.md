# Intensify3D - Tutorial

## Examples for usage modes

In this section we will demostrate the use of Intensify3D under 2 examples:

1) Images with clear signal+backgroud and no non-relevant regions in the image

2) Images with no clear signal with non-relevant regions in the image (Tissue area)

3) Images with clear signal with non-relevant regions in the image (Tissue area)



# Example 1 - 3D Speres Images with clear signal+backgroud

This dataset was generated artificially and a gradient of imaging intensity was generated in all xyz dimentions.
Different samples were generated by "different acquisition parameters" hence the baseline intensity is different. 
This Image does not have non-relevant regions so the option of **Tissue Detection is se to: No Detection**.
The Maximum Background Intensity was automatically selected and seems fitting since it detects a few pixels from the background. 
Apart from that we Assume that the background composition shoul ideally be similar at different depths so the in-stack normalization option is set to **Z-Normalization type is: Semi-Quantile**   
Between stacks, we chose a weaker assumption where we "only" want for the general intensity levels to be matched by Contrast-Stretching.

The following image shows the result of this run.
