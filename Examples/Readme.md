# Intensify3D - Tutorial

## Examples for usage modes

In this section we will demonstrate  the use of Intensify3D under 2 examples:

1) Images with clear signal+backgroud and no non-relevant regions in the image

2) Images with no clear signal with non-relevant regions in the image (Tissue area)

3) Images with clear signal with non-relevant regions in the image (Tissue area)



# Example 1 - 3D Speres Images with clear signal+backgroud

<img src="SyntheticDataExample.png?raw=true." data-canonical-src="SyntheticDataExample.png?raw=true" />


 
This dataset was generated artificially, and a gradient of imaging intensity was generated in all xyz dimensions.
Different samples were generated by "different acquisition parameters" hence the baseline intensity is different. 
This Image does not have non-relevant regions so the option of **Tissue Detection is set to: No Detection**.
The Maximum Background Intensity was automatically selected and seems fitting since it detects a few pixels from the background. 
Apart from that we Assume that the background composition should ideally be similar at different depths so the in-stack normalization option is set to **Z-Normalization type is: Semi-Quantile**   
Between stacks, we chose a weaker assumption where we "only" want for the general intensity levels to be matched by Contrast-Stretching.

The following image shows the result of this run showing representative images from the image stacks.

# Example 2 - Auto-Fluorescent  Scanning of an iDISCO brain 

<img src="GUI_iDISCO_AutoFlu3.jpg?raw=true." data-canonical-src="GUI_iDISCO_AutoFlu3.jpg?raw=true" />

Down-sampled light sheet scan of an iDISCO cleared mouse hemisphere. Scanning iDISCO samples in GFP excitation/emission settings produces a distinct auto-fluorescent signal. while informative, this signal is easily photobleached and is prune for distortions. 
Here, since there is no clear definition of signal and background I set the MBI to max value. To accurately estimate the tissue area I set the background detection to threshold mode. in terms of z normalization the composition of imaged components varies along the z axis so semi-quantile is a too strong assumption so I selected contrast-stretch. Since this is a single sample I chose "No Normalization" for between sample normalization.

# Example 3 - Alexa647 Scan of an iDISCO brain
 
<img src="GUI_iDISCO.jpg?raw=true." data-canonical-src="GUI_iDISCO.jpg?raw=true" />
 
The following example is a cortical region of an iDISCO cleared mouse with staining against endogeneuosly expressed tdTomato with alexa647. This sample has a clearly defined signal and a poertion of the image that does represent any imaged tissue. For this reason I selected the tissue detection option, a threhold cutoff and a spatial filter that is large enough to accuratly estimate
